  Hi, my name is Tamar but I mostly go by "Tammy". Me and my husband relocated from Israel to the US at 2011 and I am a mother of 2 amazing daughter , Emily who is 3 years old and Rona who will be one next month (November 11th 2015). I have a BA in phycology and sociology, and I used to worked as a developers recruiter.
After spending the last 3 years focusing on being a mother, today I am a student in Ada Developers Academy for over a month now and I couldn't be happier.
